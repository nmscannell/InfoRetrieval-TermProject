Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Control on Return from ISS
*
Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Control on Return from ISS (CCISS) will study the effects of long-duration space flight on crewmembers' heart functions and their blood vessels that supply the brain. Learning more about the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems could lead to specific countermeasures that might better protect future space travelers. This experiment is collaborative effort with the Canadian Space Agency.
Detailed Research Description 	The ability to maintain arterial blood pressure and brain blood flow immediately on return to Earth after prolonged space flight is one of the most critical factors for crew health and safety.  Although the heart rate component of the arterial baroreflex is impaired on return from space, this is not in itself a critical issue as crewmembers who are about to faint normally have markedly elevated heart rate.  Rather, their inability to maintain blood pressure appears to be related to inadequate increases in peripheral vascular resistance.  This study will incorporate a new methodology that determines the simultaneous gains of the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflexes in the control of peripheral vascular resistance.A series of six objectives have been identified that will allow a more complete understanding of any alteration in cardiovascular or cerebrovascular responses following long duration space flight.  The first two will be addressed with very brief inflight experiments that monitor the heart rate component of the arterial baroreflex and the relationship between heart rate variability and physical activity as indicators of autonomic nervous system control.  The remaining objectives will be evaluated during a 32-minute test protocol conducted pre- and immediately postflight.  During this test period, the central vein compliance will be monitored. In addition, the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflexes will be monitored during experiments that use an optimized schedule of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to manipulate arterial and central venous blood pressures.  Within these same experimental sessions assessments of cerebrovascular responsiveness to changes in arterial blood pressure and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2).  It is anticipated that the ability to regulate blood pressure through baroreflex control of blood vessel constriction will be impaired after space flight.  Similarly, it is expected that brain blood flow will be more sensitive to changes in arterial blood CO2 and, thus, will not be as tightly regulated after space flight.
BriefResearchOperations 	Crewmembers will wear a holter monitor and continuous blood pressure device for the baroreflex study while onboard ISS.Crewmembers will also wear the holter monitor and two Actiwatches to complete the 24-hr heart rate studies while onboard ISS. Space Applications 	The information derived from this study will help to better understand the effects of spaceflight on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functions. By gaining increased knowledge of the specific components of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems that deviate from the normal Earth-baseline responses, it will be possible to recommend specific countermeasures that might better protect future space travelers from complications that could put them at risk on return to the effects of gravity as will occur on re-entry to Earth or landing on the moon or Mars. Earth Applications 	The risk of fainting and falling is increased in older adults. Falls are very serious because they often cause fracture of the hip which is a major cause of prolonged disability, loss of independence and unfortunately for a high percentage of individuals the complications from the fracture will lead to death. Gaining improved knowledge of the mechanisms of loss of blood pressure and the warning signs that might predict risk will reduce the incidence of fainting and falls in the elderly.
