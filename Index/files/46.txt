Comprehensive Study of the Pattern of Main Indicators of Cardiac Activity and Blood Circulation (Cardio-ODNT Perfection)
*
SCIENCE OBJECTIVES FOR EVERYONE
Comprehensive Study of the Pattern of Main Indicators of Cardiac Activity and Blood Circulation (Cardio-ODNT Perfection) identifies the associations in regulation of human systemic and pulmonary circulation during the stages of individual adaptation to conditions of long-term microgravity using functional load testing along with the application of negative pressure to the lower part of the body (LBNP) in order to assess and predict orthostatic intolerance (dizziness upon standing up).
SPACE APPLICATIONS
The adaptation mechanisms of various levels of the human circulatory system in microgravity can be clarified from studying the functional capabilities of the human body in spaceflight. The scientific information obtained make it possible to analyze and evaluate the functional state of the cardiovascular system overall, and in particular the filling capacity and tone of blood vessels of various sizes in each region tested in accordance with criteria generally accepted in normal clinical practice, including determining functional state ranges (high, normal, and low blood pressure, high and low blood volume). Results from this study adds substantially to the knowledge of the impact of microgravity on the functional state of various parts of the cardiovascular system of crew members in long-term spaceflights.

EARTH APPLICATIONS
The scientific results of the Cardio-ODNT Perfection experiment are intended for doctors working mainly on the medical support of manned spaceflights. New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this investigation.
