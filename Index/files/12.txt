Astronaut's Energy Requirements for Long-Term Space Flight
*
Energy investigation measures an Astronaut's Energy Requirements for Long-Term Space Flight, a crucial factor needed for sending the correct amount of the right types of food with space crews. Nine astronauts will be examined during exercise and rest cycles three months before launch, three months after arriving at space station and adapting to the space environment, and after return to Earth. Physicians will measure metabolic rates, urine content, and bone density to determine energy needs.
Detailed Research Description
	Astronaut's Energy Requirements for Long-Term Space Flight (Energy) determines the crew members energy requirements for long-term space flight. There is no compensation for severe negative energy balance during space flight.. This energy deficit affects all physiological functions. Energy measures changes in energy balance after long-term space flight, adaptations in the components of the total energy expenditure, and help to derive an equation for the energy requirements of crew members.

BriefResearchOperations

		A total of 9 male subjects are needed to complete the Energy investigation. A control subject is only required for the first execution.

		Energy utilizes several dedicated meals (2 breakfast meals, 1 lunch and 1 dinner) for the inflight portion of the investigation.

		Energy utilizes the HRF-2/PFS instrument.

		Preflight measurements shall be done anytime between L-5 months and launch and remain valid for 6 months. The subjects should not have large deviations in their body mass (&plusmn;5%) in the period from Baseline Data Collection (BDC) to launch. Preflight measurements consists of 1 day of measurements and urine collection. A body mass measurement and a Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan occurs before launch. Inflight after L+3 months, and more than 3 weeks before return, a Pulmonary Function System (PFS) measurement, resting metabolic rate (45 minutes), diet induced thermogenesis (4 hours), and urine and water sampling are performed. Post-flight body mass measurement between R+2 and R+7. Except that,no Energy postflight data collection is planned, all data requirements will be obtained from Space Medicine via data sharing.


Space Applications 	Astronauts often lose body mass with extended stays in space for reasons that remain unclear, although increased exercise as a microgravity countermeasure may be a factor. Knowing details of astronaut metabolism and activity, combined with other conditions, will help ensure that crews are properly nourished on long missions.
Earth Applications 	Extended bed rest due to age or illness has some parallels to a proper energy balance. Improved understanding from space missions will help in assessing patient needs on Earth.
