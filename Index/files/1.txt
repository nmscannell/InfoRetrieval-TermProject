Cardiovascular Health Consequences of Long-Duration Space Flight
*
Cardiovascular Health Consequences of Long-Duration Space Flight (Vascular) investigates the impact of long-duration space flight on the blood vessels of astronauts. Space flight accelerates the aging process, and it is important to understand this process to develop specific countermeasures. Data is collected before, during, and after space flight to assess inflammation of the artery walls, changes in blood vessel properties, and cardiovascular fitness. Detailed Research Description The Cardiovascular Health Consequences of Long-Duration Space Flight (Vascular) investigation studies the impact of space flight on the blood vessels of long-duration space explorers. Long-term habitation on board the International Space Station can expose the human body to many unique stressors that could have life-long implications concerning cardiovascular health. The chronic change in gravitational forces, the alteration in physical activity patterns, and social factors associated with confinement, could impact structural and functional properties of the vascular system and induce changes such as accelerated stiffening and the development of atherosclerosis which may parallel the aging process. Scientists hypothesize that long-duration space travel will be associated with increased blood concentrations of markers (e.g. blood proteins) indicative of vascular growth, inflammation and oxidative stress. Scientists also hypothesize that these blood markers will accompany gravity-induced alterations in structure of arterial walls (e.g. smaller arteries), especially in the crewmember&rsquo;s legs. These blood markers of vascular growth, inflammation and stress will be obtained from blood samples before launch, in flight and return to Earth. The blood markers are correlated with non-invasive functional testing including ultrasounds of vascular dimensions, vascular compliance (elasticity), endothelium dependent dilation of arteries in the arm and the leg (using simple exercises and cuff occlusion) and endothelium independent dilation of arteries in the arm and the leg (by administering a nitroglycerin spray). The impact of these functional tests will also be evaluated for short-term cardiovascular health by comparing the altered vascular dilatory processes to the results from the upright posture testing phases of the current experiments (sit and stand) on return from ISS. These experiments will provide new information on cardiovascular structural and functional adaptations to long-duration space flight, changes that might impact crewmember&rsquo;s lifelong health, even beyond their return from ISS or during future long-duration missions. BriefResearchOperations Preflight (L-60 to L-30): Structure and function: Crewmember has ultrasounds of the blood vessels in the arms, legs and neck to measure artery size and blood flow in supine rest, sitting and standing, and during investigations of responses to increased blood flow (after release of brief occlusion to the arm or leg). A pressure-sensitive pencil probe (Millar tonometer)is held gently against the neck to measure elasticity of the arteries beneath the skin. The last phase of the experiment involves a sublingual spray of nitroglycerin during supine rest as the ultrasound measures continue. Two blood samplesare collected at least two days apart. The subject&rsquo;s bloodis drawn and then frozen for later analysis. Two sessions are needed to determine an average &ldquo;normal&rdquo; preflight concentration of the compounds circulating in the bloodstream, to be used as markers of potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease. During in flight operations, 2 blood samplesarecollected at least two days apart, NET FD 115. Cardiac rhythm data, medication and an exercise logare obtained through data sharing. During postflight operations (R+1), the structure and function testing is repeated. Blood samples are collected on R+1, and once again between R+2 and R+7. Space Applications 	The expected long-term outcome of this research involves the development of appropriate countermeasures to prevent astronauts, undertaking long-duration space flights, from experiencing long-term cardiovascular health problems as a result of their time spent in space.
Earth Applications This experiment contributes to obtaining a better understanding of the mechanisms that might contribute to premature aging of the cardiovascular system, and to detect early markers of potential atherosclerosis (condition in which fatty material collects along the walls of arteries) and inflammation.
