Assessing Telomere Lengths and Telomerase Activity in Astronauts
*
Telomeres are &quot;caps&quot; on the ends of chromosomes that protect them from fraying, much like the end of a shoelace, and an enzyme, called telomerase, maintains their length. Telomeres shorten over time, and the rate at which this occurs can be increased by stress, leading to accelerated aging, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and an impaired immune system. The Telomeres investigation collects crew member blood samples to determine how telomeres and telomerase are affected by space travel.
Detailed Research Description 	Standard assays are performed on blood samples to assess crew members&rsquo; telomere lengths and telomerase activity as part of their spaceflight biochemical profiles pre-flight (to establish baseline), during flight (to evaluate short-term/temporary changes), and post-flight (to evaluate long-term/permanent changes). Together with investigation of potential mechanisms and mitigation strategies, as well as information related to diet/nutrition, radiation exposure, gender, age, stress, genetic predisposition/sensitivity, and appropriate statistical analyses, results from this experiment can help researchers to establish relevant relationships and suggest potential interventions (e.g., antioxidants) for further study. The Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health, an electronic database of medical information collected over the active and post-career lives of the astronauts, will be a valuable resource in this regard. The proposed studies are also strongly grounded to on-going, as well as previous, biodosimetry studies utilizing chromosome aberration data. For example, samples for cytogenetic analysis from about 30 ISS astronauts have been archived, and can now be utilized (built upon) for telomere analyses.

The overall goal of this project is to characterize and begin to define the risk (and possible underlying mechanisms) of accelerated telomere shortening and changes in telomerase activity associated with spaceflight, a lifestyle with a variety of unique stressors. Consequences of accelerated telomere shortening would include advanced aging and age-associated phenotypes, ranging from reduced immune function, effects of which could be immediate/short-term and so influence performance during a mission, to cardiovascular disease and cancer, representing more long-term/permanent outcomes.
BriefResearchOperations

		Blood draws are planned 3 times pre-flight (at L-270, L-180, and L-60), and 4 times post-flight (R+7, R+60, R+180, and R+2 years).

		In-flight sessions occur at approximately FD90 and R-1 for a subset of the 6-month duration crew members, and at approximately FD45 and FD233 for a 1-year mission crew member (as part of the Twins Study). Sessions align with Soyuz vehicle return since the PI requires that blood samples be maintained at ambient temperature until return to JSC. Samples must be returned within 72 hours of collection.


Space Applications 	Long-duration spaceflight takes a toll on the body. This includes increases in physical and emotional stresses that can impact crew health. Inadequate nutrition, disrupted sleep, and microgravity itself contribute to crew stress, which in turn can contribute to shortened telomeres. Radiation exposure can also shorten telomeres. This investigation identifies the spaceflight-related risks of accelerated telomere shortening and altered telomerase activity, which can have both short-term and long-term effects. Telomere degeneration could cause reduced immune function, which could have immediate effects on crew health, or it could cause cardiovascular disease and cancer years later. Telomere maintenance is an important biomarker for space travelers dealing with inadequate nutrition, radiation exposure, and physical and psychological stress.
Earth Applications 	Stress can have dramatic effects on human health. Results from the Telomeres investigation are expected to improve understanding of how life stresses can influence telomere maintenance, which in turn is related to aging and age-related diseases. Establishing relationships between stress and shortened telomeres, including altered telomerase activity, could lead to potential countermeasures for reduced immune function, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
