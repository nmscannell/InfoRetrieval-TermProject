Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System
*
Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System (ALTEA) integrates several diagnostic technologies to measure the effect of the exposure of crewmembers to cosmic radiation. It will improve the understanding of the impacts that radiation has on the human central nervous system functions, and will study the flashes from cosmic radiation that astronauts have reported since the Apollo flights. ALTEA will also provide an assessment of the radiation environment in the ISS. Detailed Research Description 	Long-duration space flights result in increased cosmic radiation exposure to astronauts. The ALTEA hardware is designed to measure particle radiation in the space environment, and determine how this radiation impacts the central nervous system (CNS) of the crew. The experiment is comprised of a helmet-shaped device holding 6 silicon particle detectors designed to measure cosmic radiation passing through the brain. The detectors measure the trajectory, energy, and species of individual ionizing particles. At the same time an electroencephalograph (EEG) will measure the brain activity of the crewmember to determine if radiation strikes cause changes in the electrophysiology of the brain in real time. A common effect of radiation exposure that is reported by astronauts is the perception of light flashes. The actual mechanism of these light flashes is not understood. Earlier studies on the Mir space station suggest that both heavy nuclei and protons trigger abnormal CNS responses. (Casolino et al, 2003). A Visual Stimulator tests the astronaut's overall visual system, including dark adaptation stimuli to monitor visual status. . While not manned, the ALTEA hardware provides a continuous measure of the cosmic radiation in the ISS U.S. Laboratory, Destiny. The neurophysiological effects of cosmic radiation in long term space travel have never been explored with the depth of the ALTEA experiment. Data collected will help quantify risks to astronauts on future long-duration space missions and propose optimized countermeasures. BriefResearchOperations 	The crewmember will wear an EEG cap and an instrumented helmet that contains six different particle detectors which measures radiation exposure, brain electrical activity and visual system status.While not being worn by the crew member the hardware will continue measuring the radiation environment in the U.S. Lab. Space Applications 	Astronauts from Apollo missions onward have reported seeing unexplained light flashes (phosphenes), which were attributed to abnormal brain function caused by space radiation. Outside the protection of Earth's magnetic shield, ISS crewmembers are exposed to increased radiation, but the radiation environment is even more severe as exploration crews leave Earth's geomagnetic field and transit to other planets. The tests conducted using the ALTEA hardware will help scientists characterize how the heavy ion radiation of space impacts the brain and whether or not that radiation causes any temporary or permanent abnormalities in the brain function and the visual system in particular. Earth Applications 	Data provided from ALTEA can lead to further understanding of how radiation may affect brain function on Earth as well as in space. While the levels of heavy ion radiation are much higher in space that on Earth, any understanding into the way radiation may alter brain function is extremely useful to neuroscientists of these studies. Ion therapies to treat brain tumors will also benefit from the ALTEA results.
