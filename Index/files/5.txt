Bonner Ball Neutron Detector
*
Bonner Ball Neutron Detector (BBND) measures neutron radiation (low-energy, uncharged particles) which can deeply penetrate the body and damage blood forming organs. Neutron radiation is estimated to be 20 percent of the total radiation on the International Space Station (ISS). This study characterizes the neutron radiation environment to develop safety measures to protect future ISS crews. This was a cooperative experiment with Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Detailed Research Description 	The Bonner Ball Neutron Detector (BBND) developed by Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) was used inside the International Space Station (ISS) to measure the neutron energy spectrum. It consisted of several neutron moderators enabling the device to discriminate neutron energies up to 15 MeV (15 mega electron volts). This BBND characterized the neutron radiation on ISS during Expeditions 2 and 3.Due to their neutral charge, neutrons are not affected by magnetic forces and they penetrate deeper in materials and may deposit a larger fraction of their energy into human tissue than charged-particle radiations. Neutrons in the space environment are present in galactic background and solar events (primary particles), neutrons are also produced by the interaction of particles in the materials used to construct spacecraft (secondary particles). High energy secondary neutrons are produced by the interactions of high-energy charged-particles with spacecraft materials and planetary surfaces.BBND experiment hardware consists of two assemblies: the BBND control unit, which stores radiation measurements and controls data quality; and the BBND detector unit (DU), which measures neutron radiation via a series of six stainless-steel spherical shells. Four spheres are thermal neutron detectors covered in polyethylene of different thickness, one detector is covered in gadolinium; and one detector is uncovered. The gadolinium-covered sphere acts as a control; neutrons are unable to penetrate the dense gadolinium, and the data collected by the sphere are used to determine the difference between pulses created by neutrons and protons. Data collected from the polyethylene-covered spheres will shows the amount of hydrogen surrounding the detector affects the amount of radiation penetration. BriefResearchOperations 	Bonner Ball collects data continuously until return. Data transfer and data downlink are performed via the HRF workstation weekly. Space Applications 	Neutrons are uncharged atomic particles that have the ability to penetrate living tissues. Because they are neutral they can penetrate farther into tissue than other types of radiation and cause severe damage, including nerve damage, cataracts and cancer. Neutron radiation can also affect the blood-forming marrow in the bones of humans and other animals. As 20 percent of the radiation that bombards the ISS is neutron radiation, it is necessary to characterize the real-time effect.The six BBND detectors provided data indicating how much radiation was absorbed at various times, allowing a model of real-time exposure to be calculated, as opposed to earlier models of passive neutron detectors which were only capable of providing a total amount of radiation received over a span of time. Neutron radiation information obtained from the Bonner Ball Neutron Detector (BBND) can be used to develop safety measures to protect crewmembers during both long-duration missions on the ISS and during interplanetary exploration. Earth Applications 	BBND will help determine the amount of shielding needed to protect humans from neutron radiation. This data can be extrapolated to the nuclear industry to develop more effective personal protective equipment for people working with neutron radiation. PreviousMissions BBND first flew on STS-89, during which real-time, active radiation was measured as a test case for ISS missions.
