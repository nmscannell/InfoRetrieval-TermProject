New human data versus estimates of effects of inhaling fission product mixtures.
1-1-2009
Recently, data on exposures of humans as well as animals to fission products in plumes emitted by underground Soviet tests have been declassified by the Khazakhstan government and published in English. Similar human intakes of gross fission product mixtures that caused acute prodromal symptoms have not been previously reported. Animal experiments with such complex mixtures have not received sufficient support to provide data that could be reliably extrapolated with dose-response models to humans for use in triage of internally exposed persons. This commentary compares some of the acute prodromal effects on humans from the recently released Soviet data with the estimates of Cowan and Kuper, and later estimates by Brodsky and colleagues. The latter estimates are concluded to be safer, and more easily adaptable, for use in triage of persons exposed to internal deposition of fission products of various mixtures.
