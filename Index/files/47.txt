Comfort and Human Factors: AstroRad Radiation Garment Evaluation (CHARGE)
*
Comfort and Human Factors AstroRad Radiation Garment Evaluation (CHARGE) (AstroRad Vest) tests a special vest designed to protect astronauts from radiation caused by unpredictable solar particle events (SPEs). Astronauts will provide input on the garment as they wear it while performing daily tasks, including how easy it is to put on, how it fits and feels, and the range of motion it allows. Garment developers can use this input to improve design, and use of the vest protects crew members on missions to the Moon and Mars. RESEARCH OVERVIEW Crew members on the International Space Station (ISS) test the comfort of the Comfort and Human Factors AstroRad Radiation Garment Evaluation (CHARGE) (AstroRad Vest) when worn in the weightlessness of space. Each crew member wears AstroRad Vest and performs a set of tests over a three or four week timespan, providing feedback to ground teams. AstroRad Vest is developed by StemRad and Lockheed Martin to protect against the radiation produced by solar particle events in space. AstroRad Vest uses a radiation shielding technology protecting specific radiation sensitive organs, tissues and stem cell concentrations with the intent of reducing the adverse health effects of exposure to radiation, such as radiation-induced cancer. Crew members wear AstroRad Vest and perform nominal tasks such as maintenance, sleep, eating meals, cargo loading/unloading and exercise. After each of these events, the crew members fill out a survey. They answer questions about the ease of performing those tasks while wearing AstroRad Vest and provide any comments on the comfort of the vest. AstroRad Vest was developed to mitigate radiation threats to crew members on missions to the Moon and Mars. Flying AstroRad Vest on the ISS allows the designers to apply the feedback from the astronauts to improve the design and make the vest more comfortable for the crew members to wear. AstroRad Vest complements the Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment (MARE). On Orion Exploration Mission-1, MARE will characterize the radiation environment through the Van Allen radiation belts and in lunar orbit. AstroRad designers will apply data and feedback from both experiments to optimize AstroRad Vest. By improving crew member safety, AstroRad Vest is a key enabler of deep space exploration missions. DESCRIPTION Comfort and Human Factors AstroRad Radiation Garment Evaluation (CHARGE) (AstroRad Vest) is a personal protective equipment vest for astronauts. AstroRad Vest uses the International Space Station (ISS) as a ‘phase zero’ test platform in the development of this key element of cis-lunar exploration. Lockheed Martin and StemRad, a company based in Tel Aviv, Israel, developed AstroRad Vest and optimized the design to mitigate radiation threats to astronauts on missions to the Moon and Mars. Unpredictable solar particle events may deliver high radiation doses in a few hours. Wearing the AstroRad Vest reduces the chance of radiation exposure-induced death from radiation-induced fatal cancers and other short- and long-term adverse health effects. This type of garment shielding protects specific radiation-sensitive organs, tissues and stem cell concentrations. Three-dimensional selective protection by variable thickness shielding complements the body’s self-shielding. AstroRad Vest’s evaluation of human factors on the ISS ensures that this personal protective equipment will be reasonable to deploy for lunar operations. AstroRad Vest key ergonomic data collected on the ISS provides the designers with information needed to build the vest for operations on future NASA missions. On ISS, up to four female crew members evaluate AstroRad Vest. Female crew have been chosen for this evaluation because they have greater sensitivity to space radiation, mostly due to higher radiation-induced cancer risk to the ovaries and breast tissue. The crew members wear AstroRad Vest in microgravity during nominal ISS tasks, including maintenance, sleep, meals, cargo loading / unloading and exercise. They assess ergonomics, range of motion, comfort and general user experience. The crew members record feedback on a survey, providing key data to designers for future improvments. Video footage recorded during assessments show crew member range of motion limitations while wearing AstroRad Vest. AstroRad Vest project complements the Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment (MARE). On Orion Exploration Mission-1, MARE will characterize the radiation environment through the Van Allen radiation belts and in cis-lunar space. AstroRad Vest designers apply data and feedback from both experiments to optimize the vest, define operational use-cases, and improve AstroRad Vest ergonomics and function. By improving crew member safety, AstroRad Vest is a key enabler of deep space exploration missions. SPACE APPLICATIONS AstroRad Vest provides personal radiation protection for astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit, reducing their exposure to unpredictable solar particle events that can deliver high radiation doses in a few hours. Wearing AstroRad Vest reduces the chance of radiation exposure-induced death from radiation-induced fatal cancers and other short- and long-term adverse health effects. Garment shielding protects specific radiation-sensitive organs, tissues and stem cell concentrations. Three-dimensional selective protection by variable thickness shielding complements the body’s self-shielding. EARTH APPLICATIONS AstroRad Vest builds on a commercial product used for protection from exposure to nuclear radiation on Earth, which has different spectrum and energy levels than radiation in space. Data on how easy the vest is to put on and how comfortable it is to wear may inform improvements to radiation protection garments on Earth.
