Cardiac and Vessel Structure and Function with Long-Duration Space Flight and Recovery
*
As humans get older on Earth, arteries stiffen and this causes an increase in blood pressure (hypertension) and elevates the risk for cardiovascular disease. Recently, it has been observed that some crew members returning from the International Space Station (ISS) have much stiffer arteries than when they went into space. Cardiac and Vessel Structure and Function with Long-Duration Space Flight and Recovery (Vascular Echo) examines changes in blood vessels, and the heart, while the crew members are in space, and then follow their recovery on return to Earth. The results could provide insight into potential countermeasures to help maintain crew member health, and quality of life for everyone.

ResearchDescription
BriefResearchOperations
	Blood samples are collected twice pre-flight during: L &ndash; 90 to L &ndash; 60 and on-orbit (R-30 to R-1) with minimum spacing of two days apart. The subject&rsquo;s blood is drawn and then frozen for later analysis. Blood samples session is repeated six times post-flight: R + 3, R + 11 to R + 17, R + 25 to R + 31, R + 51 to R + 63, R + 1 year (+/- 7days).



	24-hr Blood Pressure Ambulatory Monitoring: One pre-flight session is required: L &ndash; 90 to L &ndash; 60. Four post-flight sessions are required: R + 5, R + 11 to R + 17, R + 25 to R + 31, R + 1 year (+/- 7days). Three in-flight sessions are required on Reserve: Early in flight = L + 20 to L + 40, mid-flight L+ 90 to R-31, and late in flight = R &ndash; 30 to R &ndash; 1.



	Resting Ultrasound (Minimum Two; Maximum Four Sessions): One pre-flight session is required: L &ndash; 90 to L &ndash; 60. Two in-flight sessions are required: early in flight = L + 20 to L + 40, and late in flight = R &ndash; 30 to R &ndash; 1. The number of post-flight sessions is crew dependent*, with a minimum of two (R + 3 to R + 5, R + 11 to R + 17) and maximum of four sessions (add R + 51 to R + 63, R + 1 year (+/- 7days)).

	Exercise Ultrasound (Minimum Two; Maximum Four Sessions): One pre-flight session is required: L &ndash; 90 to L &ndash; 60. Two in-flight session are required late in flight ( L + 20 to L + 40 and R &ndash; 30 to R &ndash; 1). The number of post-flight sessions is crew dependent*, with a minimum of two (R + 3 to R +5, R + 11 to R + 17) and maximum of four sessions (add R + 51 to R + 63, R + 1 year (+/- 7days)).



	Leg Cuff Ultrasound: One pre-flight session is required: L &ndash; 90 to L &ndash; 60. In-Flight Session: One session on Reserve as opportunity permits, L + 60 to L + 120.



	*Note: R + 56 and R + 1 year is done only if R +11 to R+17 data shows that the primary variables differed from pre-flight by >10%. Otherwise, R + 56 and R + 1 year sessions for Resting and Exercise Ultrasounds are not performed. Likewise, R + 1 year is done only if R + 56 data shows that the primary variables differed from pre-flight by > 10%. Otherwise, R + 1 year is canceled.

Space Applications
	Researchers are currently gaining an understanding of the full impact of changes in the effects of gravity and daily activity patterns while living on ISS on cardiovascular health. Recent data (published: Journal of Applied Physiology 103: 156-161, 2007; and, unpublished) have shown marked increases in arterial stiffness in many astronauts that have potential to induce long-term health consequences. This study of cardiovascular health in astronauts provides immediate feedback on the development of arterial stiffness and cardiac changes with spaceflight and provide an opportunity to examine the mechanisms responsible for these important changes in cardiovascular health. The results could provide insight into potential countermeasures to help maintain astronaut health.

Earth Applications
	Recently on Earth it has become clear that physical inactivity is associated with development of cardiovascular risk factors including arterial stiffness. The spaceflight model shows accelerated arterial stiffening thus providing a platform to explore potential mechanisms with a goal to provide interventions on Earth that slow vascular aging and improve the health and quality of life for everyone.
