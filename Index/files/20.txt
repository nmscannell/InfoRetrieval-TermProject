Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity
*
The Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) experiment involves crewmembers conducting ultrasound exams on one another to determine the accuracy of ultrasound use to diagnose certain types of on-orbit injuries and illnesses, as well as to assess the feasibility of ultrasound for monitoring in-flight bone alterations. Detailed Research Description Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) tests the accuracy of using ultrasound technology in the novel clinical situation of space flight. This investigation includes assessing health problems in the eyes and bones, as well as sinus infections and abdominal injuries. ADUM further tests the feasibility of in-flight ultrasound use to monitor bone density during long-duration space flights. Another objective of the experiment is to determine how well nonmedical crewmembers can learn to use an ultrasound device via CD ROM training manuals and remote guidance from Earth. The intent of the ADUM investigation is to develop methods by which a medically-untrained individual can use an ultrasound machine with remote diagnostician assistance to evaluate a vast array of medical problems. Expedition crews use the International Space Station (ISS) Human Research Facility (HRF) ultrasound machine and four scan sets: the cardio/thoracic scan, which focuses on the heart, but also can scan the lungs; the abdominal/retroperitoneal scan, which focuses on the organs of the abdomen, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bladder; the dental scan, which can image the mouth, teeth, gums, facial bones and sinuses, and eyes; and the bone scan, which images bones and characterizes bone loss during flight. In addition to the ultrasound machine and probes, another key component of ADUM on ISS is the onboard proficiency enhancer, a software application the crew uses to train on the methods employed for each scan. BriefResearchOperations Perform various diagnostic operations with the ultrasound on bone, heart, internal organs, teeth, eyes, and sinuses. Space Applications Aboard the ISS, there is not enough room for a fully functioning hospital or staff of doctors. It is also not feasible for a crewmember to return to Earth for a quick medical checkup. This experiment allows for efficient diagnosis of medical problems with minimal use of onboard resources. The ability of crewmembers to use an ultrasound machine with remote instruction, along with ground analysis, promotes timely treatment and averts unnecessary evacuation. Using a modification of this technology, crewmembers as far away as Mars could obtain remote examinations from doctors on Earth. This type of capability is essential for long-term space exploration. Earth Applications The use of a relatively small piece of medical equipment to diagnose various health problems, in the absence of nearby specialized medical personnel, could save lives and reduce healthcare costs. Patients could transmit ultrasound information to doctors over great distances, resulting in efficient remote medical diagnosis and treatment to a high degree of confidence. This technology essentially allows anyone in the world the potential to access unique clinical imaging expertise remotely. PreviousMissions ADUM is the first formal experiment to examine the use of ultrasound in microgravity. Crewmembers, however, did check out the ultrasound equipment during Increment 5.
